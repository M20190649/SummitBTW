Better Than WAZE (BTW) is a revolutionary smart city for better navigation through the city for all drivers. It is built and managed by the municipalities that can monitor the traffic lights of the city and manage them with smart algorithms rather than a simple static algorithm as it is today. In the future BTW will also provide services that are similar to those of popular navigation applications, such as Waze or Google Maps, with the significant advantage - the ability to control the traffic lights in real-time. This functionality can prove vital in an age where self-driving autonomous cars are gaining popularity and slowly changing the face of modern transportation.
