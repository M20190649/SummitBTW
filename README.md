Better Than WAZE (BTW) is a revolutionary city navigation application. It is built for the comfort of the citizens, and managed by the municipalities. BTW provides services that are similar to those of popular navigation applications, such as Waze or Google Maps, but offers a significant advantage - the ability to control the traffic lights in real-time. This functionality can prove vital in an age where self-driving autonomous cars are gaining popularity and slowly changing the face of modern transportation.
